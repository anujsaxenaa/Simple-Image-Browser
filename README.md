Creating a simple online image browser

Visit >> http://anujsaxenaa.github.io/Simple-Image-Browser


This is a work in progress, below are some functionalities that being built:
- Logically activating the previous and next buttons
- Having images fit to page
- Finding a way to link a local folder to the page from which the photos are accessed 
(would thus remove the numeric buttons that currently exist)
